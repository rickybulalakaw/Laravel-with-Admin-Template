# Free Tailwind & Laravel admin dashboard template updated to Laravel 10

This is a fork of [Mosaic Lite Travel] (https://github.com/cruip/laravel-tailwindcss-admin-dashboard-template)

## Initial Features 

1. Modified users table linked to positions and offices table for user-office relationship 
2. Uses MFA using Google Authenticator 

## Deployment Options 

There are two ways you can deploy this: With Docker or on the host using Composer and NPM. 

# Deployment Details with Docker Using Laravel Sail

The system uses Laravel's Sail package. Thus, the production host should have Docker Engine installed. 

_The repository includes PHPMYADMIN and MAILPIT containers for development. Make sure to make the appropriate changes in docker-compose.yml and .env file, as applicable, for development and production._ 

## Instructions for Installation
1. Make sure you have Docker running.  
2. Clone the repository in your machine.

Depending on your operating system, you may need to change ownership and access rights of files in your folder to allow write.

3. Go to the project folder. 
4. Copy the env.example file to .env 

```
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Make adjustments to your .env file, such as the name of the database and the username and password to access it. 

6. If installing in a Linux OS, create a vendor folder: 
```
mkdir vendor
```

Then change the access rights to allow writing to the following folders: vendor, storage, and bootstrap. 

6. Install Laravel Sail
```
docker run --rm \
-u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
-v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
-w /var/www/html \
laravelsail/php82-composer:latest \
composer update --ignore-platform-reqs
``` 

then 

```
docker run --rm \
-u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
-v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
-w /var/www/html \
laravelsail/php82-composer:latest \
php artisan sail:install
```

7. Run the containers.
```
sail up -d
```

8. Generate application key: 

```
sail artisan key:generate
```

9. Run migration 

```
sail artisan migrate
```

10. Install NPM packages 

```
sail npm install
```

```
sail npm run build
``` 

or 

```
sail npm run build -- --watch
```
_The "watch" switch will make the "build" run interactively so that any new classes you create will be re-built._

11. Remove excess code, such as extra controllers, migration files, and models.

12. Delete the .git folder.  
_This steps is needed to remove previous repository history as you will create a new repository for your own project._

```
sudo rm -R .git
```


13. Create your own .git repository for pushing to Github or other GIT Server.

```
git init
```

```
git add . 
```
_Take note of the period at the end which means add everything from this directory and its sub-directories._


```
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

14. Create online repository and follow instructions for pushing local repository. 
15. Build your own code! 


# Deployment on the Host with Composer and NPM 

This method requires that you have the following on the host: 

* PHP 8.++
* Composer
* NPM and 
* MySQL 

*Reminder: This option runs Laravel without other services available in the Docker option, such as Mailpit and PHPMYADMIN.*

1. Clone the repository in your machine.

Depending on your operating system, you may need to change ownership and access rights of files in your folder to allow write.

3. Go to the project folder. 
4. Copy the env.example file to .env 

```
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Make adjustments to your .env file, such as the host and name of the database and the username and password to access it. 

6. If installing in a Linux OS, create a vendor folder: 
```
mkdir vendor
```

7. Generate application key: 

```
php artisan key:generate
```

8. Make sure to run MySQL or your database server. 

9. Run migration 

```
php artisan migrate
```

10. Install NPM packages 

```
npm install
```

```
npm run build
``` 

or 

```
npm run build -- --watch
```
_The "watch" switch will make the "build" run interactively so that any new classes you create will be re-built._

Test if you could access your project by deploying your project: 

```
php artisan serve 
```

Access your project in your browser in 127.0.0.1:8000 (or whatever is displayed in the terminal). 

11. Remove excess code, such as extra controllers, migration files, and models.

12. Delete the .git folder.  
_This steps is needed to remove previous repository history as you will create a new repository for your own project._

```
sudo rm -R .git
```

13. Create your own .git repository for pushing to Github or other GIT Server.

```
git init
```

```
git add . 
```
_Take note of the period at the end which means add everything from this directory and its sub-directories._


```
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

14. Create online repository and follow instructions for pushing local repository. 

15. Build your own code!

## Usage

This project was built with [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/) and [Livewire + Blade](https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/introduction.html#livewire-blade) as Stack.

### Setup your .env config file
Make sure to add the database configuration in your .env file such as database name, username, password and port.

### Install Laravel dependencies
In the root of your Laravel application, run the ``php composer.phar install`` (or ``composer install``) command to install all of the framework's dependencies.

### Migrate the tables

In order to migrate the tables and setup the bare minimum structure for this app
to display some data you shoud open your terminal, locate and enter this project
directory and run the following command

``php artisan migrate``

### Generate some test data

Once you have all your database tables setup you can then generate some test data
which will come from our pre-made database table seeders.
In order to do so, in your terminal run the following command

``php artisan db:seed``

N.B. If you run this command twice, all the test data will be duplicated and added to the existing table data, if you want to avoid having duplicate test data please
make sure to ``truncate`` the following ``datafeeds`` table in your database.

### Compile the front-end

In order to compile all the CSS and JS assets for the front-end of this site you need to install NPM dependencies. To do that, open the terminal, type npm install and press the ``Enter`` key.

Then run ``npm run dev`` in the terminal to run a development server to re-compile static assets when making changes to the template.

When you have done with changes, run ``npm run build`` for compiling and minify for production.

### Launch the Laravel backend

In order to make this Laravel installation work properly on your local machine you
can run the following command in your terminal window.

``php artisan serve``

You should receive a message similar to this
``Starting Laravel development server: http://127.0.0.1:8000`` simply copy the URL
in your browser and you'll be ready to test out your new mosaic laravel app.
